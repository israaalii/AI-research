        The foundations of artificial intelligence
      </h1>
      <h2>Philosophy (428 B.C.-present)</h2>
      <p>
        The safest characterization of the European philosophical tradition is
        that it consists of a series of footnotes to Plato. <br />
        We begin with the birth of Plato in 428 B.C. His writings range across
        politics, mathematics, physics, astronomy, and several branches of
        philosophy. Together, Plato, his teacher Socrates, and his student
        Aristotle laid the foundation for much of western thought and culture.
        The philosopher Hubert Dreyfus (1979, p. 67) says that "The story of
        artificial intelligence might well begin around 450 B.C." when Plato
        reported a dialogue in which Socrates asks Euthyphro,3 "I want to know
        what is characteristic of piety which makes all actions pious... that I
        may have it to turn to, and to use as a standard whereby to judge your
        actions and those of other men."4 In other words, Socrates was asking
        for an algorithm to distinguish piety from non-piety. Aristotle went on
        to try to formulate more precisely the laws governing the rational part
        of the mind. He developed an informal system of syllogisms for proper
        reasoning, which in principle allowed one to mechanically generate
        conclusions, given initial premises. Aristotle did not believe all parts
        of the mind were governed by logical processes; he also had a notion of
        intuitive reason.

        Now that we have the idea of a set of rules that can describe the
        working of (at least part of) the mind, the next step is to consider the
        mind as a physical system. We have to wait for Rene Descartes
        (1596-1650) for a clear discussion of the distinction between mind and
        matter, and the problems that arise. One problem with a purely physical
        conception of the mind is that it seems to leave little room for free
        will: if the mind is governed entirely by physical laws, then it has no
        more free will than a rock "deciding" to fall toward the center of the
        earth. Although a strong advocate of the power of reasoning, Descartes
        was also a proponent of dualism. He held that there is a part of the
        mind (or soul or spirit) that is outside of nature, exempt from physical
        laws. On the other hand, he felt that animals did not possess this
        dualist quality; they could be considered as if they were machines. An
        alternative to dualism is materialism, which holds that all the world
        (including the brain and mind) operate according to physical law.5
        Wilhelm Leibniz (1646-1716) was probably the first to take the
        materialist position to its logical conclusion and build a mechanical
        device intended to carry out mental operations. Unfortunately, his
        formulation of logic was so weak that his mechanical concept generator
        could not produce interesting results. It is also possible to adopt an
        intermediate position, in which one accepts that the mind has a physical
        basis, but denies that it can be explained by a reduction to ordinary
        physical processes. Mental processes and consciousness are therefore
        part of the physical world, but inherently unknowable; they are beyond
        rational understanding. Some philosophers critical of AI have adopted
        exactly this position, as we discuss in Chapter 26. Barring these
        possible objections to the aims of AI, philosophy had thus established a
        tradition in which the mind was conceived of as a physical device
        operating principally by reasoning with the knowledge that it contained.
        The next problem is then to establish the source of knowledge. The
        empiricist movement, starting with Francis Bacon's (1561-1626) Novwn
        Organum,6 is characterized by the dictum of John Locke (1632-1704):
        "Nothing is in the understanding, which was not first in the senses."
        David Hume's (1711-1776) A Treatise of Human Nature (Hume, 1978)
        proposed what is now known as the principle of induction: that general
        rules are acquired by exposure to repeated associations between their
        elements. The theory was given more formal shape by Bertrand Russell
        (1872-1970) who introduced logical positivism. This doctrine holds that
        all knowledge can be characterized by logical theories connected,
        ultimately, to observation sentences that correspond to sensory inputs.7
        The confirmation theory of Rudolf Carnap and Carl Hempel attempted to
        establish the nature of the connection between the observation sentences
        and the more general theories—in other words, to understand how
        knowledge can be acquired from experience. The final element in the
        philosophical picture of the mind is the connection between knowledge
        and action. What form should this connection take, and how can
        particular actions be justified? These questions are vital to AI,
        because only by understanding how actions are justified can we
        understand how to build an agent whose actions are justifiable, or
        rational. Aristotle provides an elegant answer in the Nicomachean Ethics
        (Book III. 3, 1112b): We deliberate not about ends, but about means. For
        a doctor does not deliberate whether he shall heal, nor an orator
        whether he shall persuade, nor a statesman whether he shall produce law
        and order, nor does any one else deliberate about his end. They assume
        the end and consider how and by what means it is attained, and if it
        seems easily and best produced thereby; while if it is achieved by one
        means only they consider how it will be achieved by this and by what
        means this will be achieved, till they come to the first cause, which in
        the order of discovery is last . . . and what is last in the order of
        analysis seems to be first in the order of becoming. And if we come on
        an impossibility, we give up the search, e.g. if we need money and this
        cannot be got: but if a thing appears possible we try to do it.
        Aristotle's approach (with a few minor refinements) was implemented 2300
        years later by Newell and Simon in their GPS program, about which they
        write (Newell and Simon, 1972): The main methods of GPS jointly embody
        the heuristic of means-ends analysis. Means-ends analysis is typified by
        the following kind of common-sense argument: I want to take my son to
        nursery school. What's the difference between what I have and what I
        want? One of distance. What changes distance? My automobile. My
        automobile won't work. What is needed to make it work? A new battery.
        What has new batteries? An auto repair shop. I want the repair shop to
        put in a new battery; but the shop doesn't know I need one. What is the
        difficulty? One of communication. What allows communication? A telephone
        . . . and so on. This kind of analysis—classifying things in terms of
        the functions they serve and oscillating among ends, functions required,
        and means that perform them—forms the basic system of heuristic of GPS.
        Means-ends analysis is useful, but does not say what to do when several
        actions will achieve the goal, or when no action will completely achieve
        it. Arnauld, a follower of Descartes, correctly described a quantitative
        formula for deciding what action to take in cases like this (see Chapter
        16). John Stuart Mill's (1806-1873) book Utilitarianism (Mill, 1863)
        amplifies on this idea. The more formal theory of decisions is discussed
        in the following section.
