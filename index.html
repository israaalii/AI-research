          <h3>Acting humanly: The Turing Test approach</h3>
          <p>
            &emsp;The Turing Test, proposed by Alan Turing (1950), was designed
            to provide a satisfactory operational definition of intelligence.
            Turing defined intelligent behavior as the ability to achieve
            human-level performance in all cognitive tasks, sufficient to fool
            an interrogator. Roughly speaking, the test he proposed is that the
            computer should be interrogated by a human via a teletype, and
            passes the test if the interrogator cannot tell if there is a
            computer or a human at the other end. Chapter 26 discusses the
            details of the test, and whether or not a computer is really
            intelligent if it passes. For now, programming a computer to pass
            the test provides plenty to work on. <br />
            <strong>
              The computer would need to possess the following
              capabilities:</strong
            >
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <b>natural language processing</b> to enable it to communicate
              successfully in English (or some other human language).
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>knowledge representation </b>to store information provided
              before or during the interrogation.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>automated reasoning </b> to use the stored information to
              answer questions and to draw new conclusions;
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>machine learning </b> to adapt to new circumstances and to
              detect and extrapolate patterns.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <img src="images/1fd65-img4.png" alt="" width="50%" />
          <p>
            Turing's test deliberately avoided direct physical interaction
            between the interrogator and the computer, because physical
            simulation of a person is unnecessary for intelligence. However, the
            so-called total Turing Test includes a video signal so that the
            interrogator can test the subject's perceptual abilities, as well as
            the opportunity for the interrogator to pass physical objects
            "through the hatch." To pass the total Turing Test, the computer
            will need computer vision to perceive objects, and robotics to move
            them about. Within AI, there has not been a big effort to try to
            pass the Turing test. The issue of acting like a human comes up
            primarily when AI programs have to interact with people, as when an
            expert system explains how it came to its diagnosis, or a natural
            language processing system has a dialogue with a user. These
            programs must behave according to certain normal conventions of
            human interaction in order to make themselves understood. The
            underlying representation and reasoning in such a system may or may
            not be based on a human model.

          <h3>Thinking humanly: The cognitive modelling approach</h3>
          <p>
            &emsp;If we are going to say that a given program thinks like a
            human, we must have some way of determining how humans think. We
            need to get inside the actual workings of human minds. There are two
            ways to do this: through introspection—trying to catch our own
            thoughts as they go by—or through psychological experiments. Once we
            have a sufficiently precise theory of the mind, it becomes possible
            to express the theory as a computer program. If the program's
            input/output and timing behavior matches human behavior, that is
            evidence that some of the program's mechanisms may also be operating
            in humans. For example, Newell and Simon, who developed GPS, the
            "General Problem Solver" (Newell and Simon, 1961), were not content
            to have their program correctly solve problems. They were more
            concerned with comparing the trace of its reasoning steps to traces
            of human subjects solving the same problems. This is in contrast to
            other researchers of the same time (such as Wang (I960)), who were
            concerned with getting the right answers regardless of how humans
            might do it. The interdisciplinary field of cognitive science brings
            together computer models from AI and experimental techniques from
            psychology to try to construct precise and testable theories of the
            workings of the human mind. Although cognitive science is a
            fascinating field in itself, we are not going to be discussing it
            all that much in this book. We will occasionally comment on
            similarities or differences between AI techniques and human
            cognition. Real cognitive science, however, is necessarily based on
            experimental investigation of actual humans or animals, and we
            assume that the reader only has access to a computer for
            experimentation. We will simply note that AI and cognitive science
            continue to fertilize each other, especially in the areas of vision,
            natural language, and learning.

          <h3>Thinking rationally: The laws of thought approach</h3>
          <p>
            &emsp;The Greek philosopher Aristotle was one of the first to
            attempt to codify "right thinking," that is, irrefutable reasoning
            processes. His famous syllogisms provided patterns for argument
            structures that always gave correct conclusions given correct
            premises. For example, "Socrates is a man; all men are mortal;
            therefore Socrates is mortal." These laws of thought were supposed
            to govern the operation of the mind, and initiated the field of
            logic. The development of formal logic in the late nineteenth and
            early twentieth centuries, which we describe in more detail in
            Chapter 6, provided a precise notation for statements about all
            kinds of things in the world and the relations between them.
            (Contrast this with ordinary arithmetic notation, which provides
            mainly for equality and inequality statements about numbers.) By
            1965, programs existed that could, given enough time and memory,
            take a description of a problem in logical notation and find the
            solution to the problem, if one exists. (If there is no solution,
            the program might never stop looking for it.) The so-called logicist
            tradition within artificial intelligence hopes to build on such
            programs to create intelligent systems. There are two main obstacles
            to this approach. First, it is not easy to take informal knowledge
            and state it in the formal terms required by logical notation,
            particularly when the knowledge is less than 100% certain. Second,
            there is a big difference between being able to solve a problem "in
            principle" and doing so in practice. Even problems with just a few
            dozen facts can exhaust the computational resources of any computer
            unless it has some guidance as to which reasoning steps to try
            first. Although both of these obstacles apply to any attempt to
            build computational reasoning systems, they appeared first in the
            logicist tradition because the power of the representation and
            reasoning systems are well-defined and fairly well understood.

          <h3>Acting rationally: The rational agent approach</h3>
          <p>
            &emsp;Acting rationally means acting so as to achieve one's goals,
            given one's beliefs. An agent is just something that perceives and
            acts. (This may be an unusual use of the word, but you will get used
            to it.) In this approach, AI is viewed as the study and construction
            of rational agents. In the "laws of thought" approach to AI, the
            whole emphasis was on correct inferences. Making correct inferences
            is sometimes part of being a rational agent, because one way to act
            rationally is to reason logically to the conclusion that a given
            action will achieve one's goals, and then to act on that conclusion.
            On the other hand, correct inference is not all of rationality,
            because there are often situations where there is no provably
            correct thing to do, yet something must still be done. There are
            also ways of acting rationally that cannot be reasonably said to
            involve inference. For example, pulling one's hand off of a hot
            stove is a reflex action that is more successful than a slower
            action taken after careful deliberation. All the "cognitive skills"
            needed for the Turing Test are there to allow rational actions.
            Thus, we need the ability to represent knowledge and reason with it
            because this enables us to reach good decisions in a wide variety of
            situations. We need to be able to generate comprehensible sentences
            in natural language because saying those sentences helps us get by
            in a complex society. We need learning not just for erudition, but
            because having a better idea of how the world works enables us to
            generate more effective strategies for dealing with it. We need
            visual perception not just because seeing is fun, but in order to
            get a better idea of what an action might achieve—for example, being
            able to see a tasty morsel helps one to move toward it. The study of
            AI as rational agent design therefore has two advantages. First, it
            is more general than the "laws of thought" approach, because correct
            inference is only a useful mechanism for achieving rationality, and
            not a necessary one. Second, it is more amenable to scientific
            development than approaches based on human behavior or human
            thought, because the standard of rationality is clearly defined and
            completely general. Human behavior, on the other hand, is
            well-adapted for one specific environment and is the product, in
            part, of a complicated and largely unknown evolutionary process that
            still may be far from achieving perfection. This book will therefore
            concentrate on general principles of rational agents, and on
            components for constructing them. We will see that despite the
            apparent simplicity with which the problem can be stated, an
            enormous variety of issues come up when we try to solve it. Chapter
            2 outlines some of these issues in more detail. One important point
            to keep in mind: we will see before too long that achieving perfect
            rationality—always doing the right thing—is not possible in
            complicated environments. The computational demands are just too
            high. However, for most of the book, we will adopt the working
            hypothesis that understanding perfect decision making is a good
            place to start. It simplifies the problem and provides the
            appropriate setting for most of the foundational material in the
            field. Chapters 5 and 17 deal explicitly with the issue of limited
            rationality—acting appropriately when there is not enough time to do
            all the computations one might like.
