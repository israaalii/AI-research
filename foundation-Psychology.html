      <h2>Psychology (1879-present)</h2>
      <p>
        Scientific psychology can be said to have begun with the work of the
        German physicist Hermann i von Helmholtz (1821-1894) and his student
        Wilhelm Wundt (1832-1920). Helmholtz applied the scientific method to
        the study of human vision, and his Handbook of Physiological Optics is
        even now described as "the single most important treatise on the physics
        and physiology of human vision to this day" (Nalwa, 1993, p.15). In
        1879, the same year that Frege launched firstorder logic, Wundt opened
        the first laboratory of experimental psychology at the University of
        Leipzig. Wundt insisted on carefully controlled experiments in which his
        workers would perform a perceptual or associative task while
        introspecting on their thought processes. The careful controls went a
        long way to make psychology a science, but as the methodology spread, a
        curious phenomenon arose: each laboratory would report introspective
        data that just happened to match the theories tint were popular in that
        laboratory.

        The behaviorism movement of John Watson (1878-1958) aid Edward Lee
        Thorndike (1874-1949) rebelled against this subjectivism, rejecting any
        theory involving mental processes on the grounds that introspection
        could not provide reliable evidence. Behiviorists insisted on studying
        only objective measures of the percepts (or stimulus) given to an animal
        and its resulting actions (or response). Mental constructs such as
        knowledge, beliefs, goals, md reasoning steps were dismissed as
        unscientific "folkpsychology." Behaviorism discovered a let about rats
        and pigeons, but had less success understanding humans. Nevertheless, it
        had a stronghold on psychology (especially in the United States) from
        about 1920 to 1960. The view that the brain possesses and processes
        information, which is the principal characteristic of cognitive
        psychology, can be traced back at least to the works of William James9
        (1842-1910). Helmholtz also insisted that perception involved a form of
        unconscious logical inference. The cognitive viewpoint was largely
        eclipsed by behaviorism until 1943, when Kenneth Craik published The
        Nature of Explanation. Craik put back the missing mental step between
        stimulus and response. He claimed that beliefs, goals, and reasoning
        steps could be useful valid components of a theory of human behavior,
        and are just as scientific as, say, using pressure and temperature to
        talk about gases, despite their being made of molecules that have
        neither. Craik specified the tlree key steps of a knowledge-based agent:
        (1) the stimulus must be translated into an internal representation, (2)
        the representation is manipulated by cognitive processes to derive new
        internal representations, and (3) these are in turn retranslated back
        into action. He clearly explained why this was a good design for an
        agent: If the orgmism carries a "small-scale model" of external reality
        and of its own possible actions within its head, it is able to try out
        various alternatives, conclude which is the best of them, react to
        fiture situations before they arise, utilize the knowledge of past
        events in dealing with the present and future, and in every way to react
        in a much fuller, safer, and more competent manner to the emergencies
        which face it. (Craik, 1943) An agent designed this way can, for
        example, plan a long trip by considering various possible routes,
        comparing them, and choosing the best one, all before starting the
        journey. Since the 1960s, the information-processing view has dominated
        psychology. It it now almost taken for granted among many psychologists
        that "a cognitive theory should be like a computer program" (Andersen,
        1980). By this it is meant that the theory should describe cognition as
        consisting of well-definej transformation processes operating at the
        level of the information carried by the input signals. For most of the
        early history of AI and cognitive science, no significant distinction
        was drawn between the two fields, and it was common to see AI programs
        described as psychological results without any claim as to the exact
        human behavior they were modelling. In the last decade or so, however,
        the methodological distinctions have become clearer, and most work now
        falls into one field or the other.
